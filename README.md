# Child Sites Toolkit

## Problem
Ad Manager publishers who are managing large numbers of child sites cannot effectively manage issues because the GAM UI does not allow users to filter or export a list of their child sites.

This solution intends to address this customer pain point by using the GAM API from Apps Script to export a list of child sites and violation reasons to a Google Sheet.
